My primary reseach interest lies at the intersection of Data Visualization and HCI, particularly with a focus on theory and methods of design studies, replication studies, and visualization for social good. My work also includes visualization evaluations, focusing on user studies and participatory design. My work aims to bridge the gap between Visualization pedagogy and research by providing methodologies and frameworks to bring reserch education within data visualization classrooms. I work at the VIS Lab at Khoury College as a Graduate Research Assistant under the supervision of my PhD advisor Prof. <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/michelle-borkin/">Michelle A. Borkin</a>. I have five years of experience in the data science field and am very passionate about inclusivity in STEM.

Besides benefitting the visualization community, the broader impact goal of this research focus is to introduce and encourage the idea of visualization for social good. Enabling novice students to perform design studies in their undergraduate/graduate level visualization courses empowers them to help the community they live in by collaborating and working with community partners and meeting their data and visualization needs through design studies.</p>

                         <p><b>Project Description:</b> The main objective of this project was to analyze the visual behavior differences between TD (typically developing) children and children with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder). The study used 12 children with ASD and 12 control children to investigate their visual behavior in smooth pursuit, saccadic eye movement and face processing mechanisms. The smooth pursuit experiment contained animations of objects moving horizontally across the screen and the saccadic test contained animations of predicable and non-predictable saccades. The third test contained images of seven different emotions. To attain the gaze data, Tobii EyeX Controller was used, and the data was obtained, processed and analyzed in MATLAB.</p>
